# Glim

**WORK IN PROGRESS!!**

Glim is a simple identity access management system that speaks some LDAP and is written in Go. Glim stands for Golang LDAP Identity Management ðŸ˜„

## Why Glim

Why not? In my case I use several tools that require a user and password to get access. Sure, we could use our Google, Twitter, Github accounts, but some of those open source tools prefer the good old LDAP protocol to authenticate, manage groups and store account information.

It's remarkable that LDAP was designed a long time ago and it's still alive and kicking. We all should develop our protocols and software in a way that they can be useful for years.

I've used LDAP servers like OpenLDAP, ApacheDS and 389DS to run my directory and used CLI or Apache Directory Studio to manage it. All of these tools are serious projects and are the best tools available when you need real LDAP servers.

The fact is that when using LDAP for authentication I've found that:

- I don't usually need all the batteries included with those LDAP servers.
- You need more time to learn how to manage and maintain those servers.
- If you want to use CLI tools, you need some time to spend learning things like LDAP schemas or LDIF (LDAP Data Interchange Format).
- It's hard to find an open source LDAP server that offers a REST API.

Finally I decided to develop my own simple identity management system that can be used with LDAP bind operations for authentication purposes and stores my team users accounts and group information. I wanted that simple server to spoke enough LDAP for my authentication purposes.

If you're looking for a full LDAP server replacement that fully understands schemas or complex search filters, please use the serious battle-tested staff, but if you want to use LDAP authentication with your applications, you want to manage your users with simple CLI commands, have a simple REST API that you can use with your applications or use a server for your automated tests, please try Glim and help me to improve it.

## Which applications can talk with Glim and authenticate users

I've tested Glim against the following awesome applications:

- [Rancher](./docs/examples/rancher.md)
- [Gitea](./docs/examples/gitea.md)
- [Portainer Community Edition](./docs/examples/portainer_ce.md)
- [Kanboard](./docs/examples/kanboard.md)

Click on the links above for sample configurations for all these applications. More applications to be added soon, please open a discussion if you want to suggest more applications or an issue if Glim is not working for you.

## How does it work

```(bash)
$ glim server start --tlscert "/tmp/server.pem" --tlskey "/tmp/server.key"

$ glim login -u cedric.daniels -p glim.doncicuto.com
Password: 
Login Succeeded

$ glim group create -n homicides -d "Homicides" -m jimmy.mcnulty,kima.greggs
Group created

$ glim user create -u lester.freamon -e lester.freamon@baltimorepolice.org -p
User created

$ glim user remove -u jimmy.mcnulty
User account deleted

$ glim logout

$ glim server stop
```

## Secured communications by design

Glim server will listen on 1323 TCP port (REST API) and on 1636 TCP (LDAPS) port and only TLS communications will be allowed in order to secure credentials and data exchange.

While I understand that you don't want to use certificates for testing, I feel that it is a good practice to use certificates from the beginning. Glim can create a fake CA and generate client and server certificates and matching private keys for testing purposes. Run the following command to create self-signed certificates for localhost and "My organization":

```(bash)
$ glim certs -o "My organization" -a "localhost,127.0.0.1"

Creating a CA certificate file and private key file...
â‡¨ Certificate file: root.pem
â‡¨ Private key file: root.key

Creating a server certificate file and private key file...
â‡¨ Certificate file: server.pem
â‡¨ Private key file: server.key

Creating a client certificate file and private key file...
â‡¨ Certificate file: client.pem
â‡¨ Private key file: client.key

Finished! All your certificates and keys should be at /tmp
```

When using the CLI a REST API will be consumed using TLS. You should use the --tlscacert flag to specify the path to your Root CA pem file or store it as ca.pem in the .glim directory at your user HOME directory. For example:

```(bash)
go run main.go user --tlscacert /tmp/root.pem
```

Failing to provide a valid CA pem file you'll receive the following error message:

```(bash)
Could not find required CA pem file to validate authority
```

## Environment variables

Glim can use the following environment variables:

- API_SECRET (**REQUIRED**): A secret string to be used with JWT tokens
- ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRY_TIME_SECONDS (OPTIONAL): Number of seconds for access token expiration (default: 3600)
- REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRY_TIME_SECONDS (OPTIONAL): Number of seconds for refresh token expiration (default: 3 days).
- MAX_DAYS_WITHOUT_RELOGIN (OPTIONAL): Number of days that we can use refresh tokens without log in again (default: 7 days).
- DB_NAME: A name for the SQLite database that will store our users and groups
- LDAP_DOMAIN (OPTIONAL): our ldap domain. Default value: example.org
- API_SERVER_ADDRESS (OPTIONAL): listen address for our REST API server. Default value: 127.0.0.1:1323
- LDAP_SERVER_ADDRESS (OPTIONAL): listen address for our LDAP server. Default value: 127.0.0.1:1636
- GLIM_URI: Glim Rest API URI (OPTIONAL format: [https://<ip|hostname>:port](https://<ip|hostname>:port)). Default value: [https://127.0.0.1:1323](https://127.0.0.1:1323)
- BADGER_DB_PATH (OPTIONAL): Directory path for BadgerDB KV store. Default value: /tmp/kv)

## Installation scenarios

### Single node scenario

Glim can run as a single instance either using its binary that you can download from the releases page or using its Docker image that can be downloaded from Docker Hub.

Glim stores your users and groups data in a SQLite database and uses [BadgerDB](https://github.com/dgraph-io/badger) as a key value storage to store API auth and refresh tokens.

### High-availability scenario - Work in progress

Glim will be able to use Postgres to store users and groups data and Redis will be used to store API auth and refresh tokens.

## LDAP Tree

When I search entries in our LDAP tree, the following diagram shows how Glim works.

![ldap_tree](./docs/images/ldap_tree.png)

Users will be shown as entries under organization unit ou=Users.

Groups will be shown as entries under organization unit ou=Groups.

## Server logging

This is a sample of a Glim server log showing REST and LDAP interaction

## Testing Glim with openLDAP client tools (ldapsearch, ldapwhoami...)

See this [page](./docs/examples/openldap.md) for examples that I used to check Glim's ability to speak LDAP.

## Limitations / Caveats

1. You can start and stop your Glim server using `glim server [start|stop]` but if you are running Glim on a Windows machine, the stop command will fail and you will have to stop it using Ctrl+C, this is due a limitation with signal handling in Windows. In a future version this behavior could be changed if I find a workaround for prospective Windows users.

2. Glim cannot reply to Root DSE requests, so you cannot use LDAP tools like Apache Directory Studio or phpLDAPadmin to browse your directory.

3. Alias dereferencing in search requests is not supported.
